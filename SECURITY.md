# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Please do not open a public issue.** Instead, report it by opening a [private security advisory](https://github.com/vanrohan/xbotremover/security/advisories/new) on GitHub. This allows maintainers to address the issue before it is disclosed publicly.

We will acknowledge your report and work with you to understand and fix the issue as quickly as possible.
